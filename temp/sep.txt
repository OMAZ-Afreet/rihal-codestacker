sustainable
environment,
DELETED actions

DELETED be
taken
DELETED this
was
DELETED the
main
takeaway

class
DELETED that
resonated
DELETED with
DELETED me
DELETED in
fact,
DELETED the
DELETED actions
DELETED with
DELETED the
most
effect
DELETED are
made
DELETED in
high
governments’
levels
however,
individuals’
DELETED actions
DELETED and
practices
can’t

opinion,
they
come
second
DELETED with
DELETED that
being
said,
DELETED i
felt
DELETED the
need
DELETED to
make
DELETED a
DELETED change
towards

better
future
DELETED for
our
beautiful
planet
DELETED and
here’s
what
DELETED i
ended
up
DELETED with
there
DELETED are
DELETED a
couple
main
changes
DELETED that
DELETED i
already
DELETED have
been
practicing
DELETED the
first
DELETED is
DELETED a
DELETED change
DELETED in
transportation
DELETED it
came
DELETED as
DELETED a
decision
made
solely
DELETED to
experience
DELETED a
new
lifestyle
DELETED without
DELETED any
intention
DELETED of
saving
DELETED the
earth
nonetheless,
i’m
glad
DELETED it
happened
DELETED and
DELETED am
even
proud
DELETED to
DELETED be
part
DELETED of
DELETED it
after
DELETED i
learned
DELETED about
DELETED it
here
DELETED in
DELETED this
class
DELETED in
2013,
DELETED i
decided
DELETED to
DELETED not
buy
DELETED nor
drive
DELETED any
car
DELETED and
rely
solely
DELETED on
public
transportations
like
DELETED the
DELETED light
rail
DELETED this
DELETED has
reduced
DELETED my
carbon
footprint
significantly
DELETED for
six
continuous
years
using
led
DELETED light
bulbs
was
DELETED the
second
DELETED change
two
years
ago,
DELETED i
switched
all
DELETED my
DELETED light
bulbs
DELETED to
leds
DELETED and
convinced
many
DELETED of
DELETED my
friends
DELETED to
DELETED do
so
DELETED with
DELETED that
being
said,
there
DELETED are
things
DELETED that
i’m
planning

DELETED in
DELETED the
near
future
i’ve
DELETED always
washed
DELETED my
cloths
DELETED in
hot
DELETED and
warm
water
knowing
DELETED that
DELETED this
uses
more
unnecessary
electrical
energy,
DELETED i
decided
DELETED to
wash
them
DELETED on
cold
using
DELETED the
co2
calculator
provided
DELETED on
canvas,
DELETED this
DELETED would
reduce
DELETED my
emissions
DELETED by
77
lbs
DELETED in
addition,
DELETED the
greatest
DELETED change
DELETED would
DELETED be
turning
down/up
DELETED the
thermostat
DELETED in
winters/summers
according
DELETED to
DELETED the
same
calculator
DELETED it
estimated
DELETED a
total
DELETED about
10500
lbs
DELETED of
co2
emission
reduction
another
huge
contributor
DELETED is
enabling
DELETED the
power
management
feature
DELETED on
DELETED my
computer
DELETED and
phone
DELETED a
big
DELETED change
DELETED that
DELETED would
DELETED be
challenging
DELETED for
DELETED me
DELETED is
waste
management
i’m
planning
DELETED to
recycle
DELETED my
waste
weekly
furthermore,
DELETED i
need
DELETED to
cut
DELETED my
goods

estimate
DELETED that
DELETED i
use
70%
DELETED of
DELETED the
things
DELETED i
buy
DELETED which
DELETED is
bad
waste
management
hopefully
DELETED by
