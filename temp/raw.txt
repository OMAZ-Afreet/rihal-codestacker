For the sake of a better and more sustainable environment, actions must be taken This  was the main takeaway of this class that resonated with me In fact, the actions with the most  effect are made in high governments’ levels With that being said, I felt the  need to make a change towards a better future for our beautiful planet and here’s what I ended up  with The first is a change It came as a decision made solely to experience a new lifestyle without any  intention of saving the earth In 2013, I decided to not buy nor drive any car and  rely solely on public transportations like the light rail Using LED light bulbs was the second change With that being said, there are things that I’m planning to change in the near future Using the CO2 calculator provided on canvas,  this would reduce my emissions by 77 lbs In addition, the greatest change would be turning  down/up the thermostat in winters/summers according to the same calculator Another huge contributor is enabling the power  management feature on my computer and phone I  estimate that I use 70% of the things I buy which is bad waste management Hopefully by the  end of this year I could improve that to 100%
